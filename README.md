# CSS Layout Comparison for Tic-Tac-Toe boards

A simple comparison of CSS layout techniques of a tic-tac-toe board.

To keep this simple and a comparison of techniques, I have not made these layouts responsive. This is certainly to the detriment of these techniques as they are ripe for responsive layouts. A real-world layout would certainly allow for resizing.

## Layout Techniques

* CSS Grid
* FlexBox
* Traditional (Floats and positioning)

## Gameplay

The point of this repo is to compare CSS techniques not to build Tic-Tac-Toe.  That said, the game is "playable".
